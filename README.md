# Professional README Generator

## Description

The Professional README Generator is a command-line application built with Node.js that streamlines the process of creating a high-quality `README.md` file for your GitHub projects. A well-crafted README is essential for providing users and potential contributors with valuable information about your project.

This application uses the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package to prompt users with a series of questions about their project. The user's responses are then used to dynamically generate a comprehensive `README.md` file, including sections for project description, usage, installation instructions, how to report issues, and guidelines for making contributions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly**: The application utilizes Inquirer to prompt users with clear and concise questions, making it easy to gather necessary information.
- **Dynamic README Generation**: The `README` file is dynamically generated based on the user's input, ensuring consistency and completeness.
